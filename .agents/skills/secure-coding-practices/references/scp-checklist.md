## 1. Input Validation

### Core principles
- Conduct all input validation on a trusted system (server-side, not client-side)
- Identify all data sources and classify them into trusted and untrusted
- Validate all data from untrusted sources (databases, file streams, etc.)

### Checklist items
- [ ] Use a centralized input validation routine for the whole application
- [ ] Specify character sets (e.g., UTF-8) for all input sources
- [ ] Encode input to a common character set before validating
- [ ] All validation failures should result in input rejection
- [ ] If the system supports UTF-8 extended character sets, validate after UTF-8 decoding is completed
- [ ] Validate all client-provided data before processing
- [ ] Verify that protocol header values in both requests and responses contain only ASCII characters
- [ ] Validate data from redirects
- [ ] Validate for expected data types using an "allow" list rather than a "deny" list
- [ ] Validate data range
- [ ] Validate data length
- [ ] If any potentially hazardous input must be allowed, implement additional controls
- [ ] If the standard validation routine cannot address some inputs, use extra discrete checks
- [ ] Utilize canonicalization to address obfuscation attacks

---

## 2. Output Encoding

### Core principles
- Conduct all output encoding on a trusted system (server-side, not client-side)
- Utilize a standard, tested routine for each type of outbound encoding
- Specify character sets (e.g., UTF-8) for all outputs

### Checklist items

---

## 3. Authentication and Password Management

### Core principles
- Require authentication for all pages and resources except those specifically intended to be public
- All authentication controls must be enforced on a trusted system (server-side)
- Establish and utilize standard, tested authentication services whenever possible

### Account & credential checklist
- [ ] Use a centralized implementation for all authentication controls, including libraries that call external authentication services
- [ ] Segregate authentication logic from the resource being requested and use redirection to and from the centralized authentication control
- [ ] All authentication controls should fail securely
- [ ] All administrative and account management functions must be at least as secure as the primary authentication mechanism
- [ ] If your application manages a credential store, use cryptographically strong one-way salted hashes (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
- [ ] Password hashing must be implemented on a trusted system (server-side, not client-side)
- [ ] Validate the authentication data only on completion of all data input
- [ ] Authentication failure responses should not indicate which part of the authentication data was incorrect
- [ ] Use only HTTP POST requests to transmit authentication credentials
- [ ] Only send non-temporary passwords over an encrypted connection or as encrypted data
- [ ] Enforce password complexity requirements established by policy or regulation
- [ ] Enforce password length requirements established by policy or regulation
- [ ] Password entry should be obscured on the user's screen
- [ ] Enforce account disabling after an established number of invalid login attempts
- [ ] Password reset and changing operations require the same level of controls as account creation and authentication
- [ ] Password reset questions should support sufficiently random answers
- [ ] If using email-based resets, only send email to a pre-registered address with a temporary link/password
- [ ] Temporary passwords and links should have a short expiration time
- [ ] Enforce the changing of temporary passwords on the next use
- [ ] Notify users when a password reset occurs
- [ ] Prevent password re-use
- [ ] Passwords should be at least one day old before they can be changed to prevent attacks on password re-use
- [ ] Enforce password changes based on requirements established in policy or regulation, with the time between resets administratively controlled
- [ ] Disable "remember me" functionality for password fields
- [ ] The last use (successful or unsuccessful) of a user account should be reported to the user at their next successful login
- [ ] Implement monitoring to identify attacks against multiple user accounts using the same password
- [ ] Change all vendor-supplied default passwords and user IDs or disable the associated accounts
- [ ] Re-authenticate users prior to performing critical operations
- [ ] Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for highly sensitive or high-value transactional accounts
- [ ] Utilize authentication for connections to external systems that involve sensitive information or functions
- [ ] Authentication credentials for accessing services external to the application should be stored in a secure store
- [ ] If using third-party code for authentication, inspect the code carefully to ensure it is not affected by any malicious code

---

## 4. Session Management

### Core principles
- Use the server or framework's session management controls
- Session identifier creation must always be done on a trusted system (server-side, not client-side)
- Use well-vetted algorithms that ensure sufficiently random session identifiers

### Checklist items
- [ ] The application should recognize only server-generated session identifiers as valid
- [ ] Set the domain and path for cookies containing authenticated session identifiers to an appropriately restricted value for the site
- [ ] Logout functionality should fully terminate the associated session or connection
- [ ] Logout functionality should be available from all pages protected by authorization
- [ ] Establish a session inactivity timeout that is as short as possible, based on balancing risk and business functional requirements
- [ ] Disallow persistent logins and enforce periodic session terminations, even when the session is active
- [ ] If a session was established before login, close that session and establish a new session after a successful login
- [ ] Generate a new session identifier on any re-authentication
- [ ] Do not allow concurrent logins with the same user ID
- [ ] Do not expose session identifiers in URLs, error messages, or logs
- [ ] Implement appropriate access controls to protect server-side session data from unauthorized access from other users of the server
- [ ] Generate a new session identifier and deactivate the old one periodically
- [ ] Generate a new session identifier if the connection security changes from HTTP to HTTPS
- [ ] Consistently utilize HTTPS rather than switching between HTTP and HTTPS
- [ ] Supplement standard session management for sensitive server-side operations (account management) by utilizing per-session strong random tokens or parameters
- [ ] Supplement standard session management for highly sensitive or critical operations by utilizing per-request (as opposed to per-session) strong random tokens or parameters
- [ ] Set the "secure" attribute for cookies transmitted over a TLS connection
- [ ] Set cookies with the HttpOnly attribute (unless you specifically require client-side scripts to read or set a cookie's value)

---

## 5. Access Control

### Core principles
- Use only trusted system objects (server-side session objects) for making access authorization decisions
- Use a single site-wide component to check access authorization, including libraries that call external authorization services
- Access controls should fail securely (deny by default)

### Checklist items
- [ ] Deny all access if the application cannot access its security configuration information
- [ ] Enforce authorization controls on every request, including those made by server-side scripts
- [ ] Segregate privileged logic from other application code
- [ ] Restrict access to files or other resources, including those outside the application's direct control, to only authorized users
- [ ] Restrict access to protected URLs to only authorized users
- [ ] Restrict access to protected functions to only authorized users
- [ ] Restrict direct object references to only authorized users
- [ ] Restrict access to services to only authorized users
- [ ] Restrict access to application data to only authorized users
- [ ] Restrict access to user and data attributes and policy information used by access controls
- [ ] Restrict access to security-relevant configuration information to only authorized users
- [ ] Server-side implementation and presentation layer representations of access control rules must match
- [ ] If state data must be stored on the client, use encryption and integrity checking on the server-side to detect state tampering
- [ ] Enforce application logic flows to comply with business rules
- [ ] Limit the number of transactions a single user or device can perform in a given period of time (low enough to deter automated attacks but above actual business requirements)
- [ ] Use the "referer" header as a supplemental check only; it should never be the sole authorization check as it can be spoofed
- [ ] If long authenticated sessions are allowed, periodically re-validate a user's authorization to ensure that their privileges have not changed; if they have, log the user out and force them to re-authenticate
- [ ] Implement account auditing and enforce the disabling of unused accounts
- [ ] The application must support disabling of accounts and terminating sessions when authorization ceases
- [ ] Service accounts or accounts supporting connections to or from external systems should have the least privilege possible
- [ ] Create an Access Control Policy to document the application's business rules, data types, and access authorization criteria/processes

## Usage in audit reports

When reporting findings, reference:
1. **Domain** (e.g., "Input Validation")
2. **Checklist item** (e.g., "Validate data range")
3. **Evidence** (code snippet, file, line number)
4. **Risk** (attack scenario)
5. **Remediation** (how to fix)

Example:
```
Domain: Input Validation
Checklist: "Validate data range"
Evidence: /app/user.py, line 42: age = request.args.get('age')
Risk: User could submit negative or excessively large values
Remediation: Add range check: if not (0 <= age <= 150): reject_input()
```
